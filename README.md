# Dynamic UI State in Shiny

This repository contains an example Shiny application with dynamic UI generation, inspired by real-world situations. The goal is to provide a user-friendly abstraction to the necessary logic to preserve the server-side results of the UI, while letting the user selectively remove pieces without interfering with the application state.
