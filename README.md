# Dynamic UI State in Shiny

This repository contains an example Shiny application with dynamic UI generation, inspired by real-world situations. The goal is to provide a user-friendly abstraction to the necessary logic to preserve the server-side results of the UI, while letting the user selectively remove pieces without interfering with the application state. 

To view a blog of the abstraction attempts, refer to [dev/README.md](https://github.com/rpodcast/dynamicui_state/blob/main/dev/README.md).

You can view the application at <https://rpodcast.shinyapps.io/dynamicui>.
